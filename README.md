This project is a Library Management System built to provide a user-friendly, efficient way to manage books, members, and transactions within a library setting. Designed for small to medium-sized libraries, it helps automate and streamline essential operations such as book borrowing, returning, and member management. With its core functionality developed using C++, it demonstrates fundamental concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) like encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.

Key Features:
Book Management: Add, delete, update, or view books with details like title, author, and availability status.
Member Management: Register new members and maintain records of active and past users.
Borrow and Return Functionality: Keep track of issued books and due dates.
Search System: Efficiently search for books using keywords such as title or author.
Transaction Logs: Track borrowing history and return transactions for better accountability.
Data Persistence: Option to store data for reuse during multiple program runs using file handling techniques.
Technologies Used:
C++: Core logic implementation utilizing OOP concepts.
File Handling: Persistent data storage for books and members.
Command-Line Interface (CLI): Simple and interactive text-based interface.
Why This Project is Important:
The Library Management System project serves as a practical implementation of C++ fundamentals, providing a real-world scenario to apply programming concepts. It is an excellent project for understanding file I/O, dynamic memory allocation, and efficient data handling. It also introduces core database operations and enhances problem-solving skills.
